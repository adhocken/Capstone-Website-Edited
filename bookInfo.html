                <h1 class="jumbotron">Who We Are</h1>
                <p>
                  We are friends, sisters in meditation, and co-creators of
                  different kinds of stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Together we have more than 60 years of meditation experience
                  between us, and a steep learning curve on personal growth that
                  is never ending. And while we're at it, it occured to us that
                  writing a meditation guide could be useful along this path.
                  It's helping us, and hopefully it's helping you, too.
                </p>

                <h1 class="jumbotron">What's in This Book</h1>
                <p>
                  This book combines material for reflection with knowledge and
                  techniques with practical advice and easy tracking tools so
                  you can build your own meditation habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will share some of what we learned through our journeys,
                  what surprised us along the way, and why we live the way we
                  do.
                </p>
                <p>This is what personal stories look like</p>
                <p>
                  Checklists: We start with a daily format, followed by several
                  weekly check-lists, and finally arrive at a monthly style.
                </p>

                <h1 class="jumbotron">The Habit, The Lifestyle, The Bliss</h1>
                <p>
                  Okay so, don't be fooled. Because as much as the bliss is
                  always available to us, we've gotta be pretty darn brave to
                  have the actual experience of it. And for most of us, to get
                  to the point where our courage becomes a way of life takes
                  time and experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Build good meditation habits, and it is within reach. To build
                  those good meditations habits, you have to commit. Use the
                  trackers, give it 30 days, and THEN review what this
                  meditation does for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We'd even go as far as saying that commitment is a requirement
                  for participating in this experiment. If that's not you, right
                  now - that's okay. We'll still be here when you can make that
                  commitment. No worries.
                </p>

                <h6 class="quote">
                  GITA: To me attention was always 'to concentrate and focus on
                  one thing with all the power you have', until I started Sahaja
                  Yoga. Over time I learned that a strong concentration or focus
                  is neither required nor helpful. Putting the attention towards
                  something is more like a gentle thought, like touching a
                  baby's nose, you wouldn't do this with all the power you have.
                  You do it gently and with love and that is how you work with
                  your attention.
                </h6>

                <h1 class="jumbotron">What is Attention?</h1>
                <p>
                  The thing that is swirling in your head and comes up with new
                  ideas and tasks you have to do every 5 seconds is not
                  attention. But these thoughts are trying very hard to take
                  your focus away and put your attention where it doesn't need
                  to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You know how to concentrate, right? That is full attention of
                  the mental system. When we talk about attention in the context
                  of meditation, think of it as the spiritual equivalent of
                  concentration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are several factors that influence our ability to "Have
                  good attention." Food plays a role, so does our general
                  environment. The most important factor: our desire. If you
                  want to have good attention, ask for it. Settle down to
                  meditation, and in your heart you can ask. The whole universe
                  is there to help, and it will, if you desire it. Did we
                  mention that it depends on your desire? Oh, we did, right,
                  just in case you didn't read that line. It is up to your
                  desire, you alone can do that.
                </p>

                  JULIE: When I started, I found this a rather vague and
                  nebulous concept. The people I was meditation with just kept
                  repeating "Put the attention on top of your head." How do I
                  put something when I don't know what it is? But I really
                  wanted to get good at meditating, so I would focus/concentrate
                  on that spot on the top of my head, sometimes touching it so I
                  could physically feel it and have a sensation to grab onto.
                  And then, after a few days of practice, I could feel something
                  different. It's a bit like holding a space in your mind that
                  is beyond the mind (wow, I am glad I can make it so crystal
                  clear!!!). Even though it is hard to put in words, trust me;
                  you will know when you feel it. And then play with it. I could
                  feel it, and then feel it waver and fade. So I set out to feel
                  it for longer, and stabilize it. Develop more robust atention.
                  Learn to direct it.

                <h1 class="jumbotron">What is Attention?</h1>
                <p>
                  Meditation is not a trance or the state of being half asleep,
                  it is the state of being away of everything, but at the same
                  time having no thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The picture of waves rolling in and receding is perhaps
                  useful; the waves are the thoughts, and in between the waves
                  coming and going, there is a gap.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when they are overlapping, there is a tiny space of
                  everything being on hold - and then crashing to shore again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we sit down to meditation, we are looking for that space.
                  When we find it we are in meditation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we pray, we talk to God. When we meditate, we hold still
                  long enough to hear God's answer.
                </p>
                <p>Holding still long enough in mind, body, and emotions.</p>
